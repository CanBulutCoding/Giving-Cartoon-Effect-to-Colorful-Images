For this project, I used 6 different colorful images to give them a cartoon effect. I explained the experiment for 1 image and add the results of other 5 images at the end of the report document which can be found in the folder 'report'.

The code is inside the folder 'code'.

Here are some code locations where you can change parameters inside the code:
line 20
line 69
line 124
line 217
line 262

The input images I used can be found in the folder 'data'.

The output images can be found in the folder 'result' with each input image.
You must be seeing 4 outputs from 4 different parts for each input image.
